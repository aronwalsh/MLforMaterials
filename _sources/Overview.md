# Overview

_Machine Learning for Materials_ (MATE70026) provides an introduction to statistical research tools for materials theory and simulation. It is a course designed for senior undergraduate and junior postgraduate students in the Department of Materials at Imperial College London.

You will consider how composition-structure-property information in materials science can be represented in a form suitable for machine learning. You will then build, train, and evaluate your own models using public tools and open datasets. 

A hybrid teaching style will be followed with a mixture of lectures and assignments. The course assumes a basic working knowledge of the Python 3 programming language.  MSc students are required to complete [Introduction to Python](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/intro-to-python) before taking this course.
